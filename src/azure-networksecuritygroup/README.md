# Azure Network Security Group Construct

This class represents an Azure Network Security Group. It provides a convenient way to manage Azure Network Security Groups and their associated rules and associations.

## What is an Azure Network Security Group?

Azure Network Security Group (NSG) is a feature in Azure that allows you to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network. NSGs can be associated with subnets or individual network interfaces attached to virtual machines.

You can learn more about Azure Network Security Groups in the [official Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/security-overview).

## Azure Network Security Group Best Practices

- Use NSGs to restrict traffic to the minimal required for your application.
- Avoid overlapping security rules that can cause confusion.
- Use named security rules for clarity.
- Regularly review and update your NSG rules.
- Use Application Security Groups (ASGs) to group virtual machines and define network security policies based on those groups.

## Azure Network Security Group Class Properties

This class has several properties that control the Azure Network Security Group's behaviour:

- `props`: Properties of the Azure Network Security Group.
- `id`: Unique identifier of the Network Security Group.
- `name`: Name of the Network Security Group.

## Deploying the Azure Network Security Group

You can deploy an Azure Network Security Group using this class like so:

```typescript
const azureNSG = new AzureNetworkSecurityGroup(this, 'myNSG', {
  resourceGroupName: 'myResourceGroup',
  location: 'West US',
  name: 'myNSG',
  rules: [...], // Define your rules here
});
```

This code will create a new Azure Network Security Group named myNSG in the West US Azure region. The NSG belongs to the resource group myResourceGroup and contains the specified security rules.

## Security Considerations
In Azure Network Security Groups, it's essential to ensure that you're not inadvertently allowing unwanted traffic. Always follow the principle of least privilege â€“ only allow traffic that is explicitly required. Regularly review and audit your NSG rules to ensure they remain relevant and secure.
