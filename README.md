# Azure Terraform CDK Constructs
Welcome to the Azure Terraform CDK Constructs project! This library offers a comprehensive suite of L2 Constructs designed to simplify and enhance the experience of building and managing Azure infrastructure with the Cloud Development Kit for Terraform (CDKTF).

## Benefits of Using L2 Constructs

With L2 Constructs, you get the following benefits:

- **Abstraction**: Higher-level abstractions over Azure resources make your infrastructure code more declarative and easier to understand.
- **Reusability**: Encapsulate common patterns and best practices in your infrastructure code, promoting reusability across different projects and teams.
- **Rapid Development**: Accelerate your cloud development process with pre-built constructs that have been tested for common use cases, allowing you to focus on your unique application logic.
- **Direct IDE Integration**: Access detailed documentation directly within your Integrated Development Environment (IDE), streamlining your development workflow: ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/terraform-cdk-constructs/main/docs/images/ide-documentation.png)


## Quick Example

This is a quick example that showcases the simplicity and power of L2 Constructs. We'll create a storage account, add a container to it, and then upload a blobâ€”all with a few lines of intuitive, object-oriented code:

```typescript

// Create a new instance of a storage account as an object
const sa = new azcdk.azure_storageaccount.Account(stack, "storageaccount", {
  name: "testStorageAccount",
  location: "eastus",
});

// Add a container to the storage account by calling a method on the storage account object
const container = sa.addContainer("testcontainer");

// Add a blob to the container by calling a method on the container object
// The path "../../../test.txt" points to the source file to be uploaded as a blob
container.addBlob("testblob.txt", "../../../test.txt");
```



## Getting Started

This guide will walk you through the process of using the Azure L2 Constructs to define and provision infrastructure on Azure. 

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. These will be used to install the CDK for Terraform and Azure provider packages.

### Installation

First, install the CDK for Terraform CLI globally using npm:

```sh
npm install -g cdktf-cli
```

Next, initialize a new CDK for Terraform project with TypeScript template:
```sh
cdktf init --template="TypeScript" --local
```
Install the AzureRM provider for CDKTF:

```sh
npm install @cdktf/provider-azurerm
```

Then, add the Microsoft Terraform CDK constructs for Azure:

```sh
npm install @micrsoft/terraform-cdk-constructs

```


### Example 1: Creating a Storage Account
Now let's create a simple Azure storage account. The following TypeScript snippet defines a storage account resource using the CDKTF:

```typescript
// Import necessary modules and classes
import * as azcdk from "@microsoft/terraform-cdk-constructs";
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, TerraformStack } from 'cdktf';
import { AzurermProvider } from "@cdktf/provider-azurerm/lib/provider";

// Define a new Terraform stack
class AzureAppInfra extends TerraformStack {
 constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
   super(scope, name);

   // Initialize Azure provider
   new AzurermProvider(this, "azureFeature", { features: {} });

   // Create a new Azure storage account with the specified name and location
   new azcdk.azure_storageaccount.Account(this, "storageaccount", {
     name: "test42348808",
     location: "eastus",
   });
 }
}

// Initialize the CDK app and synthesize Terraform configurations
const app = new App();
new AzureAppInfra(app, 'cdk');
app.synth();
```
After defining your infrastructure, generate the Terraform configuration files:
```sh
cdktf synth
```
Finally, deploy your infrastructure to Azure:

```sh
cdktf deploy
```
## Supported Languages

Currently, our CDK L2 constructs are available in the following languages:

| Language   | Status       |
|------------|--------------|
| TypeScript | [Available](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/terraform-cdk-constructs)    |
| Python     | [Available](https://pypi.org/project/microsoft-cdktfconstructs/)  |
| Java       | Coming soon  |
| C#         | [Available](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Cdktf.Azure.TFConstructs)  |

Stay tuned for updates as we work to expand support to other popular programming languages!
