# Azure Diagnostic Settings Construct

This class offers a mechanism for defining and managing Azure Diagnostic Settings resources within a CDK (Cloud Development Kit) application. It's a streamlined way to ensure that various Azure resources have the right diagnostic configurations.

## What are Azure Diagnostic Settings?

Azure Diagnostic Settings allow users to route monitoring data from Azure resources to multiple destinations, such as Event Hubs, Storage Accounts, and Log Analytics workspaces. This data includes both metrics and logs which can be used to monitor the operation and performance of Azure resources and to gain insight into their operation and configuration.

You can learn more about Azure Container Registry in the [official Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-intro).

## Diagnostic Settings Best Practices

- Always ensure that critical resources have diagnostic settings configured to capture necessary metrics and logs.
- Be selective about which logs and metrics are tracked in order to save on costs.
- Store diagnostic data in a centralized location like Log Analytics workspace for easy querying and reporting.
- Define and manage retention policies efficiently to manage costs.

## Diagnostic Settings Class Properties

This class has several properties to control the behavior of the Azure Diagnostic Settings resource:

- `name`: The name of the diagnostic settings resource.
- `eventhubAuthorizationRuleId`: The ID of the EventHub Namespace Authorization Rule.
- `eventhubName`: The name of the EventHub which should be created if it doesnâ€™t exist.
- `partnerSolutionId`: The ID of the Partner Solution to send Diagnostic Settings to.
- `storageAccountId`: The ID of the Storage Account.
- `logAnalyticsWorkspaceId`: The ID of the Log Analytics Workspace.
- `targetResourceId`: The ID of the resource for which diagnostic settings should be applied.
- `logAnalyticsDestinationType`: Specifies whether logs should go to specific resource tables or the legacy AzureDiagnostics table.
- `logCategories`: The log diagnostic categories.
- `metricCategories`: The diagnostic metrics.

## Deploying Azure Diagnostic Settings

You can deploy an Azure Diagnostic Settings resource using this class as follows:
```typescript
const azureDiagnosticSettings = new AzureDiagnosticSettings(this, 'myDiagnosticSettings', {
  name: 'myDiagnosticSettings',
  targetResourceId: '/subscriptions/12345678-1234-5678-9123-abcdef123456/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/myAppService',
  storageAccountId: '/subscriptions/12345678-1234-5678-9123-abcdef123456/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/mystorageaccount',
  logAnalyticsWorkspaceId: '/subscriptions/12345678-1234-5678-9123-abcdef123456/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/myworkspace',
  logAnalyticsDestinationType: 'AzureDiagnostics',
  logCategories: ['AppServiceConsoleLogs', 'AppServiceAuditLogs'],
  metricCategories: ['AllMetrics']
});
```

This code initializes a new Azure Diagnostic Settings resource named myDiagnosticSettings that captures specific logs and metrics for the defined App Service. The diagnostic data is stored in the specified storage account and Log Analytics workspace.

Remember, effective monitoring and diagnostics are key components to maintaining the health, performance, and security of Azure resources.
