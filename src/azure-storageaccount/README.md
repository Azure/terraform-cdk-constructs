# Azure Storage Account Construct
This documentation covers the Azure Storage Account Construct, a comprehensive class for managing various storage solutions within Azure. It provides a convenient and efficient way to deploy and manage Azure Storage resources, including Containers, File Shares, Tables, Queues, and Network Rules.

## What is Azure Storage Account?
Azure Storage Account offers a scalable and secure place for storing data in the cloud. It supports a variety of data objects such as blobs, files, queues, and tables, making it ideal for a wide range of storage scenarios.

Learn more about Azure Storage Account in the official Azure documentation.

## Best Practices for Azure Storage Account
Use different storage accounts for different types of data to optimize performance.
Enable secure transfer to ensure data is encrypted during transit.
Implement access policies and use Azure Active Directory (AAD) for authentication.
Regularly monitor and audit your storage account activity.
Azure Storage Account Class Properties
The class has several properties to customize the behavior of the Storage Account:

- **name**: Unique name of the Storage Account.
- **location**: Azure Region for the Storage Account deployment.
- **resourceGroup**: Azure Resource Group to which the Storage Account belongs.
- **tags**: Key-value pairs for resource categorization.
- **accountReplicationType**: Type of data replication (e.g., LRS, GRS).
- **accountTier**: Performance tier (Standard, Premium).

Additional properties like enableHttpsTrafficOnly, accessTier, isHnsEnabled, etc.

## Deploying the Azure Storage Account
```typescript
const storageAccount = new AzureStorageAccount(this, 'storageaccount', {
  name: 'myStorageAccount',
  location: 'East US',
  resourceGroup: myResourceGroup,
  accountReplicationType: 'LRS',
  accountTier: 'Standard',
  // Other properties
});
```
This code snippet creates a new Storage Account with specified properties.

### Creating a Storage Container
Containers in Azure Blob Storage are used to store blobs. Here's how to deploy a Container:

```typescript
const storageAccount = new AzureStorageAccount(this, 'storageaccount', {
  name: 'myStorageAccount',
  location: 'East US',
});

const storageContainer = storageAccount.addContainer("myContainer");
// Upload a local file to blob storage
storageContainer.addBlob("testblob.txt", "../../../test.txt")
```
This will create a new container named myContainer in the Storage Account and upload a local file to the Container as blob storage.

### Deploying a File Share
Azure File Share provides managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments. To deploy a File Share:

```typescript
const storageAccount = new AzureStorageAccount(this, 'storageaccount', {
  name: 'myStorageAccount',
  location: 'East US',
});

const storageFileShare = storageAccount.addFileShare("testshare")
// Upload a local file to the share
storageFileShare.addFile("testfile.txt", "../../../test.txt")
```

### Creating a Storage Table
Azure Table Storage offers NoSQL data storage for large-scale applications. Here's how to create a Table:

```typescript
const storageAccount = new AzureStorageAccount(this, 'storageaccount', {
  name: 'myStorageAccount',
  location: 'East US',
});

const storageTable = storageAccount.addTable("myTable")
```

### Adding a Queue
Azure Queue Storage enables storing large numbers of messages. To create a Queue:

```typescript
const queue = storageAccount.addQueue("myQueue")

```
### Configuring Network Rules
Network rules add an additional layer of security. Here's how to set them up:

```typescript
const storageAccount = new AzureStorageAccount(this, 'storageaccount', {
  name: 'myStorageAccount',
  location: 'East US',
});

storageAccount.addNetworkRules({
  bypass: ["AzureServices"],
  defaultAction: "Deny",
  ipRules: ["1.2.3.4/32"],
});
```
This will configure network rules for your Storage Account according to the specified properties.
